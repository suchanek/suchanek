- 👋 Hi, I’m @suchanek
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, structural biophysics, astrophysics, music and cognition in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing ProteusPy to do disulfide bond analysis on proteins in the RCSB database.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of computational models of cognition based on the topology of neurons in the brain.
